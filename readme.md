# 1. Course of AngularJs
Some exercises I did to practice. I did this to get an idea of the old angular. This is a playground I set up for myself and for others. If needed!

## 1.1. What you can find?
1. All subjects and exercises found in the course of angular JS on Udemy.
2. Release version of my first angular app most of it comes from the course so is not original.
3. Angular JS playgrounds every feature-branch is an exercise of playground.
